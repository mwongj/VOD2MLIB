# Changelog

## v1.21.0-rc.1 ? Verified Dispatcharr enrichment before filtering

- Enrich only missing metadata required by enabled year, score and genre filters, before title rules or generation. Add independent movie genre include/exclude settings.
- Cache provider responses durably by account/provider source, replay native helpers transactionally and verify metadata and episode mappings. Successful evidence has no TTL; failed enrichment defers generation and protects filter output.
- Populate missing selected series episode lists before workers, preserving batching and stable managed episode paths. Existing provider episodes are not automatically refreshed for future additions.
- Supervise and lock catalogue snapshots; previews and snapshots can update native metadata, incidental episodes and fetch state without deleting output files. Inventory rebuild and explicit root cleanup initiate no enrichment.
- Pace requests including authentication, honor retry cooldowns, and report cache reuse, verified omissions and deferred sources. Cover pinned minimum/current Dispatcharr helpers with real Django transaction compatibility checks.

## v1.20.2 — NFO-only cleanup and action layout (2026-10-03)

- Keep action descriptions and button labels compact so buttons follow the existing right-aligned layout.
- Extend NFO-only archival to enabled Emby ownership cleanup for movies and whole-show mode. Passing-filter titles such as A Different World can otherwise retain an empty VOD duplicate after owned STRMs are removed. Match existing cleanup scope/timing and provider-ID protections, preserve episode-mode folders, and report ownership archives separately in preview, results and telemetry.
- Active metadata filters archive confirmed rejected NFO-only movie/series folders, including legacy or Emby-written metadata, outside output roots with a recovery manifest. Archives preserve metadata; STRMs, symlinks, unrelated files and passing sources protect folders.
- Handle enabling filters after unfiltered generation or STRM-only cleanup, even with NFO generation disabled. Preview models planned STRM/NFO removal and reports matching archive candidates.
- Add native lookup/archive telemetry and action-result counts. Complete native lookups precede filter changes; copy verification and inventory protections preserve retryability.
- Group NFO controls under a UI heading and description; explain how plugin NFO writing, Emby ownership integration and deletion scope interact. Preserve saved settings and compatible defaults.

## v1.20.1 — one saved configuration and Save-driven scheduling

- Manual and scheduled actions use current saved settings and the same defaults at run start.
- Enable Auto-Rescan controls scheduling; Save validates and updates cron/timezone or disables the trigger. Apply and Unschedule actions are removed.
- Existing schedules retain their enabled state; new installations default off. Legacy payload snapshots are cleared and disabled queued ticks are skipped.
- Plugin-owned Django signals implement Save behavior without changing Dispatcharr source.
- README reviewed against the category, reconciliation, filtering, performance, and scheduling commits; installation links, architecture, tests, and cleanup behavior corrected.

## v1.20.0 — database-only filters and managed-output cleanup

- Independent movie/series score, year, unknown-data, and title regex rules; series genre names remain comma-delimited text.
- Generation applies current filters to existing managed output before creation batching, with edited/unverified/shared-file protections.
- Dispatcharr models are the only VOD metadata/episode source; provider fetches and native importer/freshness writes are removed.
- Finer timing telemetry, configurable series concurrency, incremental signatures, bounded parallel STRM removal, and serialized durable inventory finalization.
- Preserve plugin identity and documentation links across upgrades.

## v1.19.0 — Emby reconciliation, inventory, and background actions

- Optional Emby ownership checks with explicit libraries, conservative identity matching, whole-show or missing-episode handling, and configured failure policy.
- Ownership/source-removal preview and cleanup; verified STRM/NFO protection and persistent SQLite inventory.
- Isolated actions with deadlines, cancellation, progress and local telemetry; persistent discovery and incremental generation decisions.

## v1.18.1 — native category eligibility

- Generation and Catalogue Snapshot use active accounts and per-account/type enabled Dispatcharr categories.
- Remove legacy plugin Category Filter/Exclude fields; disabling categories alone does not remove output.


## v1.18.0 — NFO titles your media server can actually match

Everything here came out of the Dispatcharr Discord thread. No breaking changes, and no folder names change.

⚠ **The NFO title cleanup only applies to `.nfo` files the plugin writes fresh.** It never overwrites an existing NFO — that's deliberate, so your own edits are never clobbered — so an already-generated library keeps its old titles. To pull the fix through: delete the `.nfo` files (`find /your/VODS -name '*.nfo' -delete`) and re-run Generate. For series, turn `Refresh Existing Series` ON first, or episodes that already have a `.strm` are skipped before the NFO step.

- **Provider tags are stripped from NFO titles.** Titles like `4K-A+ Blade Runner 2049`, `|EN| The Matrix` or `[4K] Dune (2025)` were written into `<title>` verbatim, and since Jellyfin/Emby treat an NFO title as authoritative, the item stayed mis-titled no matter what TMDB said. Leading provider tags (`A+`, `4K-A+`, `|EN|`, `[4K]`), edge quality tokens and trailing years are now removed.

  Every step is anchored to the start or end of the title, deliberately gentler than the folder-name cleanup, and the result was checked against a live 6,877-title catalogue: 0 titles emptied, and the only non-year changes were correct ones. Names that look like junk but aren't all survive — `Love+War`, `Genera+ion`, `NTSF:SD:SUV::`, `WWII in HD`, `Chicago P.D.`, `Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.`, `[REC] 2`, `Blade Runner 2049`, `Bali 2002`.

- **New `Omit <title> from NFO files` setting** (off by default). If your provider's naming is too mangled for any cleanup to rescue, turn this on: movie and tvshow NFOs are written without a `<title>` element at all, so Jellyfin/Emby fall back to matching on the folder name and take the title from TMDB. Episode NFOs always keep their title — an episode has nothing else to identify it by.

- **Duplicate episodes are collapsed** (reported by **rammboslice**). When the same episode is reachable through more than one M3U relation, the plugin was writing a `.strm` per relation; with `Omit stream_id from URLs` on, those files resolve to identical URLs — so you'd get `S01E05`, `S01E05 (2)`, and so on, all playing the same thing. Episodes are now deduplicated by episode UUID before writing, keeping the first relation in a stable order, and the run log says `collapsed N duplicate episode relation(s)` when it happens.

- **Bigger series batch sizes** — 50, 100 and 250 join the existing options, for people running large libraries who don't want to click Generate a dozen times. The help text now warns that anything past ~25 risks the UI 504 (the job keeps running server-side regardless) and points at the schedule as the better answer for a full library.

- **Missing TMDB IDs are now reported.** With `Append TMDB ID to folder names` on, items lacking a TMDB ID in Dispatcharr were silently written without a tag, which looks like the setting is broken. The summary now counts them: `N item(s) had no TMDB ID`.

23 new unit tests (224 total, was 201).

## v1.17.0 — Category Exclude, and Scan tells you what your filter actually matches

Follow-up to [#8](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/8) (thanks **@logand99**), where a Category Filter appeared to do nothing.

The root of it: the filter matches the **category name**, but many providers put their language/content tag in the **title** (`|EN| The Matrix`) while the category is something else entirely (`FOR ADULTS`). Filtering on `|EN|` therefore matched no category — and the plugin gave no hint that was why. Three changes:

- **New `Category Exclude (block list)` setting.** Comma-separated category-name prefixes to skip, applied *after* the include filter. This is the right tool for "everything except adult content": leave `Category Filter` empty and put `FOR ADULTS` here, instead of trying to enumerate every category you *do* want. Content with no category is never excluded, so uncategorised titles aren't silently lost.

- **`[LIBRARY] Catalogue snapshot` now prints your real category names**, with movie+series counts, sorted by size. If a filter or exclude is set, each is marked ✓ (will generate) or ✗ (dropped), followed by `→ N of M categories will generate.` If nothing matches, it says so loudly — including the reminder that the filter matches the category, not the title. This turns "why is my filter not working?" into a single click.

- **Generate no longer reports a filtered-out run as an empty library.** It used to say `No movies found to process`, which reads like the catalogue is empty; when a filter/exclude is set it now says the filter matched nothing and points at the snapshot action.

No behaviour change for anyone not using the filters. 7 new unit tests (201 total, was 194).

## v1.16.1 — stop media servers re-indexing on every rescan; Jellyfin-format TMDB tags

Two bug fixes, both reported from the field.

- **`.strm` files are no longer rewritten when nothing changed, and keep their mtime when they do** ([#11](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/11), reported **with a patch** by **@bruor**). Since v1.13.0 the refresh paths rewrote every `.strm` so a changed Dispatcharr URL would propagate. But rewriting bumps the file's mtime, and media servers use mtime to decide "has this changed?" — so every nightly rescan made Emby (and Jellyfin) re-index the *entire* library despite not a byte differing.

  Now the plugin compares contents first: identical files are left completely untouched, and when a URL genuinely does change the file is written and its **original mtime restored**. The new URL is still honoured — players read the `.strm` at playback time, not from the index — but the media server has no reason to re-scan.

  Two nice side effects: a no-change rescan is now dramatically cheaper (no writes at all), and the run summary reports `.strm refreshed` (URL actually changed) separately from `.strm unchanged`, so you can see at a glance whether a rescan did anything.

- **TMDB folder tags can now use the Jellyfin/Emby convention** ([#9](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/9), thanks **@vayan**). `Append TMDB ID to folder names` only ever wrote Plex/ChannelsDVR-style `{tmdb-123}`, which Jellyfin and Emby ignore — they expect `[tmdbid-123]`. Since most of this plugin's users are on Jellyfin/Emby (Plex can't play `.strm` at all), that made the setting a no-op for the majority.

  New **`TMDB Folder Tag Format`** setting picks the convention: `Plex / ChannelsDVR — {tmdb-123}` (default) or `Jellyfin / Emby — [tmdbid-123]`. Default stays Plex so existing libraries don't get renamed; **Jellyfin/Emby users should switch it**. ⚠ Changing the format writes new folder names alongside the old ones — `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` + re-generate to migrate cleanly.

No settings migration; both defaults preserve existing behaviour. 13 new unit tests (194 total, was 181).

## v1.16.0 — language-prefix formats, category filter, optional stream_id omission

Three community-requested features, all opt-in / backwards-compatible.

- **Language-prefix stripping now handles more provider formats** ([#3](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/3), thanks **BrianWinhere** + **mola1980**). The old regex only stripped `EN - ` (dash). It now also handles:
  - **Pipe** — `EN| Alita: Battle Angel 3D` → `Alita: Battle Angel 3D` (any 2–3 letter code).
  - **Bare space, `EN` only** — `EN 27 Gone Too Soon` → `27 Gone Too Soon`. Restricted to `EN` on purpose so real titles like `IT Chapter Two`, `UP (2009)`, `ED TV` are preserved.
  - **Bullet-wrapped** — `▪NL▪ Title` / `▪MULTIG▪ Title` → `Title`.
  - The existing `AC-130` / `MI-5` carve-outs are still preserved. Applies to titles, folder names, and category-derived genres.

- **New `Category Filter (include only)` setting** ([#3](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/3), [#2](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/2)). Comma-separated category-name prefixes (e.g. `[EN],[FR]`, case-insensitive) — only content whose M3U category starts with one of them is generated. Filters at the **database-query level**, so on a 246k-folder multi-language catalogue you generate only the few thousand you want, without ever creating-then-cleaning-up the rest. Applies to both Movies and Series. Empty = generate everything (default, no change). When set, content with no matching category is skipped.

- **New `Don't pin .strm files to a specific provider stream` setting** ([#5](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/5) / [PR #6](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/pull/6), thanks **mcortt**). Omits `?stream_id=` from generated `.strm` URLs so Dispatcharr's VOD proxy can fail over across accounts by priority instead of being pinned to one relation. Default off (matches current behaviour); only useful once Dispatcharr's VOD failover ([#1398](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/pull/1398)) lands upstream, documented in the help text. Also merged as a proper `omit_stream_id` field in the catalogue manifest and refactored the URL construction into one tested `_build_proxy_url` helper.

Defaults unchanged; no settings migration. New unit tests for the language regex, category-filter parsing, and proxy-URL builder.

## v1.15.2 — active-account filter, bare-year cleanup, schedule-drift warning

Four community-reported fixes, all backwards-compatible.

- **Scan & Generate now ignore inactive providers (thanks Motronic).** Previously the plugin counted every `Movie`/`Series` row and generated `.strm` files for *all* relations — including content whose M3U provider had been deactivated upstream. So disabling a provider in Dispatcharr left its content in the plugin's Scan totals and produced dead `.strm` files. Both `[LIBRARY] Catalogue snapshot` and `[GENERATE]` now filter to relations on an **active** M3U account (`m3u_account__is_active=True`), matching Dispatcharr's own VODs UI and proxy. Scan additionally reports an **orphaned** count (content with no active provider) so the gap is explicit. *If you have orphaned `.strm` files from a previous run on now-inactive content, run `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` once, then re-generate.*

- **Bare trailing years are stripped from folder names (thanks Lid).** Providers that ship titles like `Wicked: For Good - 2025` (bare year, no parens) previously produced `Wicked: For Good - 2025 (2025)/` once the plugin added its own `(YYYY)` suffix. New `_strip_redundant_trailing_year` helper removes a bare trailing year when it matches the known year — and, when no year is otherwise known, **adopts** the bare trailing year as the folder year. Guards real titles: `Blade Runner 2049` (year 2017), `Room 1408` (year 2007), and `1984` / `2012` (where the year *is* the title) are all preserved.

- **Show Status warns when settings drift from the cron snapshot (thanks sjsteve).** The cron job runs against a snapshot of your settings taken at the last `[SCHEDULE] Apply / Update`. If you change a setting afterwards without re-applying, `[SCHEDULE] Show status` now flags exactly which keys differ and reminds you to re-click Apply. (Compared over the snapshot's keys only, so a plugin upgrade that adds new settings won't raise a false warning.)

- **Clearer folder-migration help text.** The `Append TMDB ID`, `Dedupe Movies`, and `Dedupe Series` settings now spell out that toggling them on an already-generated library does NOT rename folders in place — you get new names alongside the old ones until you `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` and re-generate.

Defaults unchanged; no settings migration. 17 new unit tests (165 total, was 148).

## v1.15.1 — dedupe movies/series across categories

Closes the first GitHub issue against this repo ([#1](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/issues/1), thanks **FCSO-byte**).

When a provider tags one movie under multiple categories (e.g. `Action` AND `Sci-Fi`), Dispatcharr stores one `M3UMovieRelation` row per (movie × m3u_account × category). With `Nest Movies by Category` ON, each row was producing a different folder path — so the same `.strm` ended up duplicated across multiple category folders. The original intent (called out in the help text) was the 4K-vs-HD variant-stream case; the multi-genre case is a fair "shouldn't be the default" outcome.

Two new opt-in toggles:

- **`Dedupe Movies Across Categories`** (default OFF, in the `[MOVIES]` section). When ON *and* `Nest Movies by Category` is also ON, the plugin writes each movie's `.strm` under the *first* category only (alphabetical by category name, deterministic tiebreaker on relation `id`) and skips subsequent ones. No effect when nesting is OFF (multi-category rows already resolve to the same folder in that case, and the existence check skips them).
- **`Dedupe Series Across Categories`** (default OFF, in the `[SERIES]` section). Mirror behaviour for series.

Run summary surfaces a new `Deduped (multi-cat)` counter so the dedup activity is visible. The query gains an `ORDER BY category__name, id` only when the dedup toggle is on, so users not opting in pay no perf cost.

The defaults preserve the existing variant-stream-friendly behaviour exactly; this is a purely additive feature for users who want one folder per title regardless of upstream tagging.

## v1.15.0 — media-server-friendliness pass

Three asks from Discord community testers in May 2026, all landed together:

- **Folder names are now scraper-friendly.** Provider VOD names like `Cool Hand Luke 4K (1967) PAUL NEWMAN (1967)` previously became a folder of the same shape, which ChannelsDVR's personal-media scraper fails to match. New `_extract_clean_name_and_year` helper truncates at the *first* `(YYYY)` (discarding the trailing junk) and strips common quality / encoding tokens (`4K`, `UHD`, `FHD`, `HD`, `SD`, `HDR`, `HEVC`, `H.264/265`, `1080p`, `720p`, `2160p`, `BluRay`, `BDRip`, `DVDRip`, `WEB-DL`, `HDTV`, `REMUX`). Result for the example: `Cool Hand Luke (1967)/`. Thanks to **sjsteve** for the report.
- **New optional `{tmdb-NNN}` folder suffix.** New boolean setting `Append TMDB ID to folder names` (default OFF) appends Plex/ChannelsDVR-friendly `{tmdb-NNN}` to every Movies and Series folder when a TMDB ID is known — e.g. `Cool Hand Luke (1967) {tmdb-378}/`. Plex's Personal Media Movies agent and ChannelsDVR's local-media scraper both honour this convention for forced exact matches, the safest defence against name collisions and bad scrapes. **Caution:** flipping the toggle on an existing library creates the new folder names alongside the old ones — `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` first or accept duplicates. Thanks again to **sjsteve**.
- **NFOs now emit a `<thumb aspect="poster">` URL.** When Dispatcharr knows the artwork URL (via `movie.logo.url` / `series.logo.url`, typically a TMDB image), the plugin emits `<thumb aspect="poster">URL</thumb>` in `tvshow.nfo` and movie NFOs so media servers can render artwork without a TMDB roundtrip. Thanks to **edison085** for the report.

No breaking changes. The simpler `_clean_title` / `_strip_trailing_year` helpers remain for NFO title generation (which wants gentler handling than folder naming).

## v1.14.3 — Show Status reflects Test fire + task completion

The Celery task now bumps `PeriodicTask.last_run_at` on completion. Previously, that field was updated only by django-celery-beat at dispatch time, which had two consequences:

- **Manual Test fire never showed up.** `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` uses `send_task()` (bypasses beat), so beat never got the chance to update the field. Test fire returned an "enqueued" toast but `[SCHEDULE] Show status` stayed frozen even after the task succeeded.
- **Cron failures looked like successes.** Beat increments `last_run_at` and `total_run_count` when it *dispatches*, not when the worker *completes*. A task that beat fired but the worker rejected (the v1.14.1 and earlier `unregistered task` failure mode) still made Show Status look healthy.

Now `last_run_at` becomes "last time the task actually finished" — Test fire clicks show up after completion, and a failing tick leaves `last_run_at` stale, a real signal you can spot. `total_run_count` is still beat-owned (counts dispatches) so a divergence between `last_run_at` and a recent `total_run_count` increment now indicates task failure.

## v1.14.2 — fix silently-failing scheduled rescans (route to `dvr` queue)

Scheduled rescans have been silently failing since at least v1.4 — beat fires the task at 03:00, the default celery worker receives it, looks up `vod2mlib.scheduled_rescan` in its registry, doesn't find it (plugins live outside `INSTALLED_APPS`, the upstream hotfix in `dispatcharr/celery.py` crashes with `AppRegistryNotReady` at module-import time, and `apps.plugins.AppConfig.ready()` short-circuits via `should_skip_initialization()` when `'celery'` is in argv), and raises `KeyError: 'vod2mlib.scheduled_rescan'`. The `total_run_count` on the periodic task still increments because that field counts beat dispatches, not successful worker executions — so the failure looks invisible from `[SCHEDULE] Show status`.

Empirically, Dispatcharr's `dvr` celery worker DOES end up with plugin tasks registered (verified via `celery inspect registered`). v1.14.2 routes the scheduled task and `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` to the `dvr` queue so the worker that actually has the task registered picks it up. The `dvr` worker is configured with a 20-thread pool, so this has no practical impact on DVR recording capacity.

**If you set up your schedule on v1.14.1 or earlier**, click `[SCHEDULE] Apply / Update` once after upgrading. That rewrites the stored PeriodicTask to set `queue='dvr'`. Without that re-click, the existing record keeps routing to the default queue (where the failure happens).

This is a workaround for an upstream Dispatcharr bug ([#1244](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/issues/1244) / [#1245](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/pull/1245)). Once Dispatcharr properly registers plugin tasks in the default worker, the `queue='dvr'` routing can be removed.

## v1.14.1 — Test fire is async; shorter Movies action description

Two small fixes:

- **`[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` no longer times out.** Previously the handler ran the scheduled action synchronously inside the HTTP request, which now (since the v1.13.0 URL-refresh work made `rescan_all` heavier) routinely exceeded nginx's 60s proxy timeout — users saw a `504 Gateway Time-out` toast. The new implementation enqueues the same Celery task that beat dispatches on a cron tick, returning the task id immediately. Verify completion via `[SCHEDULE] Show status` (the `last_run_at` field updates when the worker finishes).
- **`[GENERATE] Movies` action description shortened** back to the v1.12.0 wording. The v1.14.0 description ran over two lines in the UI, which trips Dispatcharr's flex-wrap behaviour and pushes the Run button below the title. The "use Full rescan to refresh URLs" tip now lives only in the README/CHANGELOG.

## v1.14.0 — drop the `Refresh Existing Movies` setting

Removes the user-visible `Refresh Existing Movies` toggle added in v1.13.0. The URL-refresh capability for movies stays — but it's now only triggered by `[GENERATE] Full rescan` (and the cron schedule's `rescan_all` target), via an internal kwarg on `_generate_movies` rather than a saved setting. The toggle was almost always redundant: anyone who wanted to refresh URLs would run Full rescan anyway, and that path already forces the refresh internally.

Net behaviour for users:
- `[GENERATE] Movies` (button or cron target) — same as v1.12.0 and earlier: always skips existing `.strm`.
- `[GENERATE] Full rescan` (button or cron target `rescan_all`) — same as v1.13.0: rewrites all existing `.strm` with the current Dispatcharr URL, preserves `.nfo` edits.
- The `Refresh Existing Series` setting is unchanged (still does what it did in v1.13.0 — picks up new episodes AND refreshes existing episode URLs).

If you previously saved `refresh_existing_movies: true` in plugin settings, it's silently ignored after upgrading — no breakage. Just rely on Full rescan when you need a URL refresh.

## v1.13.0 — URL refresh & user-edit preservation

Fix stale `.strm` URLs after changing `Dispatcharr URL`. Previously, once a movie or episode `.strm` was on disk, the plugin would never rewrite it — so editing the URL setting left every existing file pointing at the old address. The only workaround was `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` followed by regenerate, which also wiped user-added `.nfo` edits.

New `Refresh Existing Movies (URL refresh)` setting (default OFF, mirrors the existing `Refresh Existing Series` toggle) — when ON, `[GENERATE] Movies` rewrites existing `.strm` files with the current Dispatcharr URL while preserving `.nfo` edits (only writes `.nfo` when missing). In refresh mode, `Batch Size` caps total writes (new + refreshed) so large URL-refresh runs can be paced over multiple ticks.

`Refresh Existing Series` now also rewrites existing episode `.strm` URLs (previously it only picked up *new* episodes — existing episodes silently kept the old URL). `tvshow.nfo` is no longer overwritten in refresh mode, preserving user metadata edits. Episode `.nfo` was already preserved.

`[GENERATE] Full rescan` and the cron schedule (`rescan_all`) force both refresh flags ON, so URL changes propagate automatically on the next scheduled tick — no manual intervention or cleanup-then-regenerate dance required.

## v1.12.0

New `Schedule Timezone` setting (IANA name like `Europe/London`, `America/New_York`; default empty = UTC). The cron expression is now interpreted in that timezone, so `0 3 * * *` in `Europe/London` fires at 03:00 local time year-round — DST handled automatically. `[SCHEDULE] Show status` now reports the timezone alongside the cron. New `help_url` manifest field pointing at the README — Dispatcharr's plugin tile renders this as a link next to the author name, so users can find the docs without leaving the UI. Validator (`_validate_timezone`) rejects invalid IANA names at Apply time with a helpful error pointing at the timezone list. 7 new unit tests (113 total).

## v1.11.0

Optional category-nested folder layout. Two new boolean settings (both default OFF): `Nest Movies by Category` and `Nest Series by Category`. When ON, each item's folder is wrapped in a subfolder named by its raw M3U category — useful when your provider organises content by genre. Items without a category land under `Unassigned/`. Items present under multiple categories (e.g. 4K vs HD) get separate folders intentionally. Cleanup actions refactored to walk recursively (`os.walk`) so they handle both flat and nested layouts in one pass — empty Season / series / category folders are removed bottom-up, user-added files (subtitles, posters, extras) are still preserved. **Layout-change warning:** flipping a `Nest by Category` setting after generation does NOT migrate existing folders — the new layout coexists alongside the old. Run `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up Movies` / `Series` followed by `[GENERATE]` to fully switch layouts. 17 new unit tests (106 total).

## v1.10.1

Year-bucket category names like `2026 Movies` / `1990s Series` / `2026 TV Shows` are no longer emitted as fake genres. These come from IPTV providers that organize their VOD catalogue by year rather than by genre — passing them through to media servers actively confuses genre browsing in Plex/Jellyfin/Kodi. Now: when the only category-derived genre would be a year-bucket, no `<genre>` tag is emitted at all. Plex/Jellyfin/CDVR will fetch real genres from TMDB themselves via the `<tmdbid>` we already emit. Real categorical genres (`Action`, `Drama, Crime`, `Action / Adventure`) pass through unchanged. Mixed cases (`Action / 2026 Movies`) keep the real part and drop the bucket. 13 new unit tests (89 total).

## v1.10.0

NFO files now emit external IDs and richer metadata, dramatically improving identification by ChannelsDVR / Jellyfin / Plex / Kodi / Emby. `tvshow.nfo` and `episode.nfo` get `<tmdbid>`, `<imdbid>`, and Kodi-style `<uniqueid type="tmdb"|"imdb">` (movie NFO already had IDs; gets `<uniqueid>` now too). Series and episode NFOs additionally get `<rating>`. Episode NFO gets `<aired>` (from `air_date`) and `<runtime>` (from `duration_secs`). Genre selection now prefers Dispatcharr's DB-stored `Series.genre` / `Movie.genre` (TMDB-grade values like "Sci-Fi & Fantasy") over the M3U-category-derived genre (which often produced unhelpful values like "Australian Tv"). Falls back to the category when the DB field is empty. 22 new unit tests (76 total). Existing folders need a regenerate to pick up the richer NFOs — `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up Movies` / `Series` then `[GENERATE]` will refresh them.

## v1.9.4

Closes a real footgun reported on the Dispatcharr Discord against the legacy v1.3 plugin: a user edited the Dispatcharr URL field but never clicked Save, so every `.strm` file silently shipped the placeholder URL `http://192.168.99.11:9191` and nothing played. Now: the Python class default is empty, the placeholder `http://192.168.99.11:9191` is rejected on action with a clear error, and a fresh installer is forced to set the URL before anything generates. As a separate concession to host-network setups, the localhost reject is downgraded to a warning — a setup with Dispatcharr and the consumer on the same host with shared network namespace can legitimately use `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`. Validation is centralised in `_validate_dispatcharr_url`, with 9 new unit tests (54 total).

## v1.9.3

Replaced the auto-generated V-on-gradient `logo.png` with custom pixel-art artwork (a CRT showing "VOD" with a download arrow into a `.STRM` file). Source kept at `tools/source_logo.png`; `tools/build_logo.py` resizes to 512×512 with NEAREST resampling.

## v1.9.2

Display name changed from `VOD2MLIB` to `VOD to Media Library`. Slug, repo URL, install folder name, and Celery task identifiers all unchanged.

## v1.9.1

Trimmed `[GENERATE] Full rescan` and `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` descriptions to keep their Run buttons right-aligned.

## v1.9.0

NFO titles no longer include the year (Kodi/Jellyfin scrapers prefer just the title). Shared language-prefix regex between `_clean_title` and `_extract_genres`. `_generate_movies` now uses `query.iterator()` so the batch limit is honoured even when most candidates are already-done. Magic numbers promoted to class constants. New `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` action. Failed series names surface in the rescan summary. New `tests/` directory with 45 unit tests.

## v1.8.x

Section dividers on Settings tab, action labels match the design's renaming map, full-rescan confirm dialog, `[BRACKET]` style headers.

## v1.7.x

UI clarity: button colors, confirm dialogs in Python class, accurate descriptions, `Rescan all` forces refresh-existing.

## v1.6

Rescan-friendly: per-episode skip, optional M3U re-fetch, `Refresh Existing Series` toggle. Schedule rescans now actually pick up new episodes.

## v1.5

Submission-ready: `plugin.json` manifest, MIT/attribution, `__init__.py`. Bug fixes: duplicate-year folders, AC-130 over-strip, batch-limit unreachable for series, episode query at DB level, `checkbox` → `boolean`, scan counts unique not relations. Cleanup is now non-destructive.

## v1.4

Cron-driven auto-rescan via `django-celery-beat`. New `Rescan All` action.

## v1.3 and earlier

See [shedunraid's upstream](https://github.com/shedunraid/VOD2MLIB) for the original v0.x–v1.3 history.
